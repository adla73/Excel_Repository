Kickstarter Statistics

Background
Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. 

Analysis
A sample of 4000 Kickstarter projects are divided into 9 categories and 41 sub categories. Most projects seeking funding are theater plays, with the highest success rate but also the highest failure rate. While it is a clear majority, this category is average in terms of  failure/success. Music projects, mainly rock music projects, have the highest success rate. The overall success rate for all projects is in May, while most projects are cancelled in July. In December, more projects fail than succeed. No journalism projects have been successful.
Data demonstrates that music projects in February through May have the highest probability for success.
